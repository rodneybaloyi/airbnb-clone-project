- Supports complex queries for search and filtering functionality
- Handles relationships between users, properties, and bookings

 Prisma
Purpose: Modern database ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool
- Simplifies database operations with type-safe queries
- Generates database client based on schema definitions
- Handles database migrations and schema changes
- Provides excellent TypeScript integration

 Authentication & Security

 JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Purpose: Secure method for transmitting information between client and server
- Manages user authentication and session handling
- Provides stateless authentication mechanism
- Secures API endpoints from unauthorized access
- Enables user login persistence across browser sessions

 Payment Processing

 Stripe
Purpose: Complete payment processing platform
- Handles secure credit card processing for bookings
- Manages payment intents and confirmations
- Provides fraud protection and security compliance
- Supports multiple payment methods and currencies

 File & Media Management

 Cloudinary
Purpose: Cloud-based image and video management service
- Stores and optimizes property images and user profile pictures
- Provides automatic image resizing and format optimization
- Delivers images through global CDN for fast loading
- Offers image transformation capabilities

 Testing & Quality Assurance

 Jest
Purpose: JavaScript testing framework
- Provides unit testing for individual components and functions
- Offers snapshot testing for UI component consistency
- Includes mocking capabilities for testing API calls
- Generates code coverage reports

 Development & Deployment Tools

 Git
Purpose: Distributed version control system
- Tracks changes in source code during development
- Enables collaboration among team members
- Manages different versions and branches of the codebase
- Provides backup and history of all code changes

 Docker
Purpose: Containerization platform
- Packages applications and dependencies into portable containers
- Ensures consistent environment across development and production
- Simplifies deployment and scaling processes
- Isolates applications from system-specific configurations

 Development Workflow Integration

 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Purpose: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Automatically runs tests when code is pushed
- Deploys applications to production environments
- Ensures code quality through automated checks
- Manages environment-specific configurations

 ESLint & Prettier
Purpose: Code quality and formatting tools
- Maintains consistent code style across the project
- Identifies and fixes common programming errors
- Enforces coding standards and best practices
- Automatically formats code for better readability
